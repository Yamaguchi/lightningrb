    # For example, suppose that we have a `feerate_per_kw` of 5000, a `dust_limit_satoshis` of 546 satoshis,
    # and commitment transaction with:
    # * 2 offered HTLCs of 5000000 and 1000000 millisatoshis (5000 and 1000 satoshis)
    # * 2 received HTLCs of 7000000 and 800000 millisatoshis (7000 and 800 satoshis)
    #
    # The HTLC timeout transaction weight is 663, thus fee would be 3315 satoshis.
    # The HTLC success transaction weight is 703, thus fee would be 3515 satoshis
    #
    # The commitment transaction weight would be calculated as follows:
    #
    # * weight starts at 724.
    #
    # * The offered HTLC of 5000 satoshis is above 546 + 3315 and would result in:
    #   * an output of 5000 satoshi in the commitment transaction
    #   * a HTLC timeout transaction of 5000 - 3145 satoshis which spends this output
    #   * weight increases to 896
    #
    # * The offered HTLC of 1000 satoshis is below 546 + 3315, so would be trimmed.
    #
    # * The received HTLC of 7000 satoshis is above 546 + 3590 and would result in:
    #   * an output of 7000 satoshi in the commitment transaction
    #   * a HTLC success transaction of 7000 - 3590 satoshis which spends this output
    #   * weight increases to 1068
    #
    # * The received HTLC of 800 satoshis is below 546 + 3515 so would be trimmed.
    #
    # The base commitment transaction fee would be 5340 satoshi; the actual
    # fee (adding the 1000 and 800 satoshi HTLCs which would have made dust
    # outputs) is 7140 satoshi.  The final fee may even be more if the
    # `to_local` or `to_remote` outputs fall below `dust_limit_satoshis`.
